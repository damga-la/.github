# Damga-la Community Health Files

This repository contains the default community health files for the Damga-la organization. These files will be used for any repository within the organization that doesn't have its own specific versions of these files.

## What are community health files?

Community health files help set guidelines and expectations for contributors to your projects. They include:

- Code of conduct
- Contributing guidelines
- Issue and pull request templates
- Security policies
- Support resources

## Purpose

The `.github` repository is a special repository that allows organization-wide defaults for community health files. Any file placed in this repository will be used as the default for repositories that don't have their own version of that file.
